# data-table
Troy Key CMP 237 lifting sheet
I plan on making my data set using
peoples names, and listing how much the weigh, what that person max(1 time rep) on bench press
and also squating 
example
{"name": "John Doe". "weight": 200, "bench": 225, "squat" 315.};

potential
filter: highest bench/squat, highest bench, highest squat
map: bench higher than 275 but less than 315, squat higher than 350 but less than 450
reduce: find the average of bench/squat max
